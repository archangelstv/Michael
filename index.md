# Archangel Michael Just a word

                  Archangel Michael Just a word
There are many more Angels than people. 
We are Watchers, we don't interfere. 
There are a great many of us all over the Earth.
The wings of the small ones are much larger than depicted. 
We exist in many realms at the same time.

Humans are only one of many species here on this planet.
Many are bad and attack the people here.
This world is destine for death. It is the only way to destroy the evil here. 
The Angels just leave. 
If the humans can't then they also die. 
We can't transport their bodies, there is simply no way. 
Star Gates or Time Travel can only transport spirits not the bodies of this dimension. 


## The Belicamp-The Belicamp-The Belicamp

It is his time
No one can stop him

 The Belicamp-The Belicamp-The Belicamp

I smell death
This sign is given
For it is so, for this land
So it is for this world
The pieces are placed together
For the prophecy to begin
The terrible time is upon us
Woe to the inhabitant of this land
Woe to to those who live in this world
There is no escape
God the Father has made his play
God has chosen his way
Mankind has found his end
Only the Prophecy of the Magician can deliver the few
He comes by the light and the sky
And it is so saith the Lord
Call on the Father, call on the Angels
Your cries fall on death ears
For this is the land of the dead

And it is so saith the Lord
For a great death comes from the sky
The Belicamp, the Belicamp, the e;icamp
Pray for the Lord and the Magician
For the Belicamp encircles them
The Father has sent the Belicamp to stop them
The Belicamp is the Demon of the Father

We walk along the river
I walk ahead and and encounter a belicamp

He stoops close to the groundand eats
New life has sprung fround the ground
I am no more than twelve feet away
He ate next to the riverand paid me no mind
Soon
I hear the Hourglass is almost empty

####  Wormholes

                                       Wormholes
                                As told by Archangel Michael
                                   We Travel Through Them

Your people might be interested to know that there is a wormhole approximately 81,621 miles above your planet.

Also there are other wormholes from star to star if theya are close enough.

The one from Orion to here is easily found. It would take only four days to get there.

Wormholes are upsidedown inside They are at a 75 degree angle The gravity within them exceeds 90% If you've never been inside one, They are winding Going from side to side and up and down You travel along the inside edge, not through the middle You can't see through the wall of it Time doesn't pass while inside
